# This is a one-liner filter script
# It reads a list of 'bad words' from a blacklist file
# and filters all filenames beneith a specified directory
# for those words and removes them.
#
# This could easily modified to enable replacing the words
# with specific replacement words. It could still remain a 
# one-liner for that, allthough it might get about 50% longer.
